# Cypress Practice Tests

This repository contains my **learning journey with Cypress**, starting from zero knowledge.  
Here you will find **practice tests on different websites**, exploring a variety of scenarios and techniques in end-to-end testing.

## ðŸš€ What you will find in this repo
- **Navigation tests**: checking page loads, URLs, and user flows
- **Form tests**: filling inputs, validating fields, submitting forms
- **Element verification**: testing elements by **ID**, **class**, **attributes**, or text content
- **Dynamic content**: testing sliders, modals, and elements loaded via JavaScript
- **Interactions**: clicking buttons, links, checkboxes, dropdowns, etc.

> Each folder usually represents a different website or type of test, so you can see how I practice various real-world scenarios.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
- Learn **Cypress from scratch**  
- Practice **writing reliable end-to-end tests**  
- Improve skills in **automation, selectors, and verification**  
- Build a portfolio showing my **testing knowledge and hands-on practice**
